# IMU Mechanization

This project was created by Adam Smith as a final project for ENGO 623 at the University of Calgary.

In this project, we implement IMU mechanization to compute navigation information in the local level frame. NumPy as well as pure Python implementations are included.  For more information, see the [project report](<./ENGO623 Project - Adam Smith.pdf>).
